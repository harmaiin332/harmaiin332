## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** working with **Agentic AI** — smart systems that can think, plan, and act on their own.

💡 I create modern websites and web apps using both **frontend** and **backend** technologies.  
🧠 I enjoy using AI to build tools that are not just smart, but also useful for real people.  
🎯 My goal is always to write clean code, build fast apps, and solve real-world problems.
